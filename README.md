# TextileDesign

Processing code that illustrates repeated images of two whales in love. This programmed design was printed on fabric and used to make a zippered pouch. Contains three main functions with a color input: drawing a single whale, a single heart, and the whale couple with a heart between them. Also contains an output function in order to calculate the amount of pixels in the inches of fabric wanted. Used bezier curves in order to achieve the curves of the whale’s body.
